I ran past the security as it scanned my face for identification. It was 8:55 and I had a presentation at 9 for my boss and some of the top executives of the company about our general AI. The next day At 5 P.M, there was going to be an online event about the same thing, and it was not ready yet! This presentation was supposed to be the finished product, ready to be given to the company's spoke person and all the graphics complete. 

I dashed to the conference room where I found 5 people staring at me. The boss Mrs. Mattews smiled at me and said: "Good morning Emma. I see you are trying hard to reach our deadlines. Do you have the presentation?"

Mr. Jameson, the spokesperson scowled and said: "I should have had the complete presentation a week ago. I should prepare, you know." 

Mrs. Mattews turned to him. 

"I've seen you improvise a perfectly valid presentation, and that is what made us hire you for this company. You get the presentation when it is ready. And if it is not, you can just improvise and earn your huge salary."

I was mortified that I was watching the higher-ups of the company arguing over something that I had had a hand in. So I apologized: " I'm really sorry Mr. Jameson, the PR department was adamant that we add the current projects too, not just our Global Warming Reversal project. And they asked me to add in 5 other projects just last night."

"What? Why? The Global Warming Reversal is the best work we have, and it literally saves every human being on the planet! Why should we advertise our other works before they've done anything significant?"

I was getting ready to project the charts on the smart wall as Mr. Jameson was talking. I answered him while hooking up my phone to the wall: " That is what I said, but they say since our company is a non-profit international company funded by every country that agreed to the Ethical AI accord, we should show the world that we are working to improving the everyday life of normal people."

"Saving everyone is not improving their lives?!"

"They want more tangible projects." I projected my phone on the smart wall and decided to forego the presentation in favor of talking about making it ready: " These slides are the ones talking about Global Warming Reversal. It is a general overview of what it is, why it is important, the technology we are using, and how AI helped with what we could and should do."

Mrs. Mattews stood up from her seat and put her hands on my shoulders: "Slow down Emma. We have more than 32 hours to work on this. It is going to be alright." I adore her. She single-handedly improves the name of all Bosses around the world. I breathed and relaxed and continued:

"These charts show the trend reversal of global warming, just in the last 5 years, the temperature dropped by 1 degree. Of course, even if we reach the preindustrial era global average temperature, there are still damages that we could not reverse. Like all the sweet waters in the ice caps that have melted into the ocean. But it is orders of magnitude better than what we had 5 years ago. "

Andrew, Mr. Jameson's assistant wrote a note on his phone and said to his boss: "I can have a graphic designer animate these charts, to be shown while you talk about it."

"So this is the biggest piece,"  Mr. Jameson said: "but they want us to talk about other projects that can benefit the average person pretty fast. What do you have in mind Emma?"

" I've listed the top 5 most promising projects that we are doing." I switched to the slide that shows the top 5 projects: " This list is based on the results so far. The first one is the Energy project, which is a combination of energy-saving and energy-generating projects. I thought it would be better to combine the two as a single unit to show a better overall picture. Already, we save more than 20 percent of electricity on the sites where this program is running the trial run. And energy production saw a rise of 15 percent overall in sea wave, wind, and solar farms." 

Mr. Jameson was a bit skeptical: "But these numbers don't mean much to people. And you say this is our best project?" 

"Yes! We can show them the energy cost, maybe?" 

"I think annual cost savings would work best." He said to his assistant, then motioned to me to carry on.

"Well, the next best project of ours is the drug prediction models. We successfully finished the first trial phase of the drug that was predicted by our AI models." I was preparing myself for disappointment, but to my amazement, Mr. Jameson was quite intrigued with this one.

"What drug is it and what disease does it suppose to cure? We can show the disease in a scary light which would make the drug a miracle."

Mrs. Mattews interjected here: " Oh I quite disagree, we do not want to say such a lie to the public. This is a nonprofit, international company and we do not need to convince shareholders. Tell about this project as it is, not anything more."

Mr. Jameson lost a bit of his enthusiasm and waved at me to tell him about the next project. 

"The next one is the Recycling project, and as the title suggests it is about using AI in recycling. For years recycling was not sustainable, because the cost was a lot higher than the gains. But with the use of fast detection systems thanks to AI, we can separate all the material into basic components, making recycling a lot more cost-effective. We are using this method at 2 sites now and we could get 85 percent of the total value being recycled."  

I could see that Mr. Jameson was not happy with this so I moved on to the next project: "The self-driving arsenal is also one of the most profitable projects we have. It is not yet fully realized but predictions based on what we have so far shown almost half the cost of an average consumer product from start to finish, and a more speedy delivery, and a more robust supply chain."

Mrs. Mattews was smiling in a relaxed manner which calmed me further, but I could see Mr. Jameson was not on board. He said:" This is a terrible project to show. The self-driving cars and trucks took many people's jobs, and those people are still resentful about it, even though their lives are better now. And why do we even call this project self-driving arsenal? Doesn't this project contains ships and planes and drones?" 

"Yes, but the name explains the function of this AI system, and most of the units are actually driving, rather than piloting or other stuff. But I think we should include it because this project has a lot more benefits! From halving the response time of emergency to lack of traffic, this is one of the more visible projects we have!"

"Yes, and the drawbacks are more visible too. So I strongly advise against showing this until much later. Like a decade from now. Tell me about the next project, what is the Pandemic Prevention project, is that even possible?"

I discarded my objection when I saw Mrs. Mattews wasn't so keen on showing the Self-driving Arsenal either, gathered my thoughts, and carried on: 

"Well Pandemic Prevention is in its early stages, and we can't be sure it works because it needs a global healthcare system, which is at least 5 years in the future. But it is working in simulations, and the trial runs in the united states are promising too. It works by flagging rapid growth patterns of diseases in the population and warning the hospitals and doctors. It also checks the spikes in common symptoms for new diseases." 

Mr. Jameson was more on board with this project: "Yes this is a good one. Most of us remember the Covid-19 pandemic and how that whole mess ruined everything. So This is a project that we could easily show average viewers. But the self-driving thingy is not good. Recycling is also not good. People don't really want to know about their trash, or how what they are using now used to be trash. Now, I know for a fact that we are working on ending the world's hunger for good. Why can't we show that?"

"Because we had little to do with ending the world hunger?"

"But AI was used, wasn't it?"

"It was even before the ethical AI day. Our company didn't even exist back then!"

"That does not matter, the food shortage is ending, AI was used to address this problem and we are currently working on using AI in food production. So I think we should introduce these projects too." He turned to Mrs. Mattews and said: "This is not a lie either. I don't even  have to embellish anything more than what we really do."

He stood up and said: "I think this is a start, at least. One successful project and 4 promising ones. I believe the most eye-catching of our projects would be the Universal Basic Necessities and Global Healthcare, but I don't think they are promising enough for this year. Let's hope we can include them in the next Ethical Day conference. Emma, send the accurate numbers to Andrew, please. Now if you excuse me, I have to get ready for tomorrow." He left the room with his assistant, making me relax for the first time this morning. 

After that Mrs. Mattews and I parted ways too. I went to my office to work on the numbers I was tasked with. Time flew without me achieving all my goals, and before I knew it, my stomach was protesting quite loudly. I checked the time and it was 3 P.M. Only two hours until I had to give my report to Andrew, yet I could not work anymore on an empty stomach. I hadn't had anything to eat since the previous night so I headed to the cafeteria and ordered a lab-grown hamburger.

Sean, one of the guys who worked under me found me on my way to the office: "Hey boss, you've been absent today."

"I'm pretty busy, I have to finish the reports by the end of the day and I don't think I will be able to."

Sean said he was finished and offered to help, which I gladly accepted. With his help, I barely managed to finish the report and send it to Andrew. 

We headed out together, and after the security identification, Sean looked at me and said: "Hey boss, tomorrow is a big day, and you have been stressed enough today. What say you to a cup of coffee? We can invite our significant others and relax." 

"Come on Sean, I've told you before, at least outside the work hours listen to me and call me Emma. And coffee is a wonderful idea."

After finding out my husband was out of the country until the next week, and his partner had to work late, we decided to walk to the coffee place, order takeout, and head our ways. On the way, we talked about Ethical AI day. 

"Why don't we go over the history of the Ethical AI day at the event Emma? I've seen the presentation and there was no mention of anything before the Accords."

"People don't want to remember those dark times where artificial intelligence was being used for warfare Sean. It is too soon. We have a bright future, and I don't think the event is for ruining people's day."

"But it is important! People should not forget that without the accords, humans could have gone extinct by now!"

"Yes it is important, but no one is forgetting that. It's just, that the event is about the future, not the past."

I could see Sean was not convinced. But I believe I was right. Sure, for some time, we could have absolutely ruined everything, but, in the end, humanity came together and agreed to use AI for good. Every single one of us was benefitting from it. 

After the coffee, Sean said his goodbyes and left. I decided that I didn't need to be home anytime soon, and thanks to recent advancements, it was quite safe for me to wander around town in the dark. 

I walked aimlessly in the general direction of my home, enjoying a quiet starry night. The future looks bright.
